The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document.

```bash
values:     static|relative|absolute|fixed|sticky
initial:    static
applies:    all elements
inherited:  no
animatable: no

# static (default)
  - element box generated as normal
  - block elements in document flow
  - inline elements in

# relative
  - positioning context is the original element position
  - element is not removed from normal flow

# absolute
  - positioning context is the parent element position
  - element is removed from normal flow

# fixed
  - positioning context is the viewport

# sticky
  - experimental (as of 2020)
```
